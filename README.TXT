# react-website1
This is a web home page i built using ReactJs. 
I plan on building out the other pages in the future, but right now they are blank.

Things I learnt during this project:
How to make the webpage look good on desktop, tablet and mobile phone view.
How to make a hamburger navbar for mobile view.
Hover effect over the buttons.
